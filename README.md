# Milkmaid-syndrome
This repository demonstrates the so-called "Yellow Milkmaid Syndrome"

Finding images of cultural heritage objects, such as paintings, is easier than ever. Simply feeding a search engine like Google or Bing the title of a painting will get you a tidal wave of images of that specific painting. There is, however, one problem. The majority of images will be of low quality and are not guaranteed to accurately represent the original painting. This becomes problematic when inaccurate representations become more widespread than true images of the paintings. In cultural heritage studies, this occurrence has been called “the Yellow Milkmaid Syndrome.” The term was coined by Europeana in 2011. The following image viewer serves to illustrate the Yellow Milkmaid Syndrome; to make the user aware of this challenge in digital cultural heritage research.

Use the search box to search for images on Bing images, using their API. The first two results will be displayed in the viewer that allows you to compare the two images in various modes and you can zoom and change the brightness. It is advised to search for heritage objects like paintings, buildings or artefacts using search terms like 'Monet Impression Sunrise' or 'Raphael school of Athens'.
